# Building Vibration and Shock Analysis System

## Overview

This project is designed to **analyze vibrations and shocks in buildings**, offering a practical demonstration for civil engineers. The system measures real-time vibrations induced by a motor on different building configurations, allowing engineers to evaluate and compare structural responses under dynamic loading.

## Project Description

The project showcases three different building models:

1. **Simple Building:**  
   A basic building structure without additional reinforcements.

2. **Diagonal Syringe Building:**  
   A building model that features a syringe-like support attached diagonally on each floor, simulating an innovative damping mechanism.

3. **Beam Supported Building:**  
   A building enhanced with additional support on the beam to improve stability and reduce vibrations.

**Sensor Placement:**  
Vibration sensors (accelerometers) are installed at the top of each building model to capture the intensity and frequency of vibrations or shocks generated by the motor.

## Features

- **Real-Time Vibration Monitoring:**  
  Continuously measures and displays vibration data.
- **Multi-Model Analysis:**  
  Compare the dynamic responses of three different building designs.
- **Data Visualization:**  
  Visualize vibration data via an LCD display and through a real-time graph generated by a Processing sketch.
- **Alert System:**  
  Uses a buzzer and LEDs to signal when vibration levels exceed preset thresholds.

## Components Used

- **Arduino Uno:**  
  Serves as the primary microcontroller for sensor data acquisition and system management.
- **Vibration Sensors/Accelerometers:**  
  Mounted at the top of the building models to measure vibrations.
- **LCD Display:**  
  Displays real-time vibration readings.
- **Buzzer and LEDs:**  
  Provide immediate feedback if vibration thresholds are surpassed.
- **Motor:**  
  Generates vibrations/shocks for testing the building models.
- **Processing (Software):**  
  For real-time data plotting and further visualization.

## Setup and Installation

### Hardware Setup

1. **Sensor Installation:**  
   - Attach the vibration sensors at the top of each building model.
   - Ensure the sensors are securely mounted and properly aligned.
2. **Circuit Connections:**  
   - Connect the sensors, LCD, buzzer, and LEDs to the **Arduino Uno** following the provided schematic.
   - Set up the motor so that its operation induces measurable vibrations in the building models.

### Software Setup

1. **Arduino Code:**  
   - Open the provided Arduino sketch.
   - Adjust calibration values if necessary.
   - Upload the code to your **Arduino Uno** using the Arduino IDE.
2. **Processing Code:**  
   - Download and install Processing from [processing.org](https://processing.org/download/).
   - Open the provided Processing sketch.
   - Modify the serial port configuration (for example, change `/dev/ttyACM0` to your systemâ€™s appropriate port, such as `COM3` on Windows).
   - Run the sketch to start visualizing real-time vibration data on the graph.

## Data Analysis

The system collects and displays critical data such as:
- **Vibration Amplitude:**  
  The magnitude of vibrations, indicating the intensity of shocks.
- **Frequency of Events:**  
  The number of vibration or shock events over a given period.
- **Comparative Analysis:**  
  Evaluates the effectiveness of different structural supports (simple, diagonal syringe, and beam support) in mitigating vibrations.

Civil engineers can use this data to assess the performance of various structural designs under dynamic conditions and explore potential improvements in building design.

## Usage Considerations

- **Calibration:**  
  Ensure that all sensors are properly calibrated before testing for accurate measurements.
- **Controlled Environment:**  
  Perform tests in a controlled setting to reduce interference from external vibrations or noise.
- **Data Logging:**  
  Optionally, implement data logging for long-term analysis and further research.
